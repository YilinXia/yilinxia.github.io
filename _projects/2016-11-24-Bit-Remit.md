#### Project feasibility

**Mechanism feasibility**<br>
Through calculating, bitcoin price ratio in the United States, China, and the real exchange rate maintain a high level of consistency, providing strong support for the following work.<br><br>
At the same time, via the actual operation (Model 1: single platform double account experiment  Model 2: international dual platform), finally we choose the model 2 as the model of our platform, and the lowest fee is about 0.14%[1]（From USA to China）, about 0.05%(From China to the USA), much lower than the domestic rate of major financial institutions. What’s more, according to the mechanism of the process, the total transfer time can realize real-time, and spend a short period.<br><br>
Bitcoin spot and futures price spread is generally not more than 2 yuan, the price can be considered both highly similar. Trade on BitVC, and it can effectively prevent the economics risks from abnormal fluctuations of bitcoin.<br><br>
**Feasibility of policy and regulation.**<br>
The document called Bank[2013]No.289 points out that the website providing services related to bitcoin should have been filed in the telecommunications regulatory agencies. And the website should require the users’ real name registration. Also when finding the suspicious transactions, the institution should give feedback to the China anti-money laundering monitoring and Analysis Center report immediately. So non-financial institutions and nonpayment institutions can provide services related to bitcoin operation obeying the laws.<br><br>
The document called Remit[2007]No1. points out that the money which domestic citizens want to remit can not exceed about fifty thousand dollars or other currency equivalent charge. If someone wants to remit more than fifty thousand dollars, he needs to apply. The limit set in the platform fully meets the relevant laws.
[1] Single platform dual account: select China bitcoin trading platform – Huobi website, respectively, use CNY account and USD account for operation.
Cross border dual platform: select Chinese bitcoin trading platform – Huobi.com, the corresponding U.S. platform - CoinBase, and do the double platform transactions operation.<br><br>

Cross border dual platform:select Chinese bitcoin trading platform – Huobi.com, the corresponding U.S. platform - CoinBase, and do the double platform transactions operation.*

#### Project mechanism
Take the cross border remittance between China and the United States as an example: China's customers want to transfer money to the United States friends or relatives.<br><br>
While users begin to fill orders and the system will lock the rate, the preferred method will get one domestic bitcoin trading platform, one foreign bitcoin trading platform according to the real-time data. Then users fill in the remittance table with details and submit orders. After platform confirming the receipt of customer’s money and remittance fee, the dollar account of the platform transfer the USD to the target account. The arrival time will depend on the remittance time in the USA.<br><br>
During the remitting, automatic transaction set will do related operations in the two platforms which preferred method got before: the platform will purchase some bitcoins equal to the remittance, then transfers the bitcoins to the bitcoin account in the USA. Then the bitcoin will be sold, and the money will be recharged into the USA account.
In the transaction process, to prevent the loss of funds caused by the bitcoin prices changes, the trading platform has an automated set: using the customer funds to buy and sell the bitcoin in the futures market, playing a role in hedging.
